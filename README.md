# endeavour
General-purpose systems programming language with a C-like syntax that compiles to native code. Inspired, resembling and originating from D and OpenD.

For now, I refer you to the "OpenD" language, which was forked on January 1st, 2024 from the D language. 

This language (endeavour) lives, for now, only in a private fork of OpenD. But, in fact, it is exactly the same language with a changed name.

Consider this repository as a future place holder for the OpenD language. 

# meander
Already some syntactical changes to OpenD / endeavour are being developed, independently of the troika D / OpenD / endeavour, and resulted in yet another new language, "meander". 

For now, meander lives in a private repository.
