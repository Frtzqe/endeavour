# endeavour
General-purpose systems programming language with a C-like syntax that compiles to native code. Inspired, resembling and originating from D and OpenD.

For now, I refer you to the "OpenD" language, which was forked on January 1st, 2024 from the D language. 

This language (endeavour) lives, for now, only in a private fork of OpenD. In fact, it is the same language (for now), but the first small syntax changes are in development. 

Consider this repository as a future place holder for the OpenD language.
